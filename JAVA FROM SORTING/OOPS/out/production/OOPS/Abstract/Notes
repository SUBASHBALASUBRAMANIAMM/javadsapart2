Abstract will only provide the name or initialisation of method not the body of the method it is child's responsibility to provide the body
the child must override the the method which defined as abstract
if any one method is abstract then the whole class must be defined as abstract

syntax
abstract void fun-name(param);

we cant create object of an abstract class as normal method if we have to do so we should override those abstract method
we cant create a abstract constructor
